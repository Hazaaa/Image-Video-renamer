# Image/Video name renamer

Have you ever had that problem when you want to create folder with your favourite picture from your dream vacation and your friends or family send you more pictures that they took? And now you have a lot of pictures with different names and timestamps, so all of your picture are out of order now... I've had same problem so i created simple Python app that will remove any prefix in image name (eg. IMG_, VID_, PIX_, ...) and it will leave picture name with just timestamp (eg. YYYYMMDD_HHmmss.extension).
Notice: Any picture that have name different from normal timestamps (eg. from Viber or WhatsApp) will be copied in "InvalidFiles" folder in your destination folder.

## How to use it:

1. Clone this repo or just download this .exe file
2. Open with any IDE (best with VSC) or start .exe file
3. First select source folder with your pictures
4. Then select destination pictures where you want renamed pictures to be copied
5. When finished you'll just need to check "InvalidFiles" folder in your destination folder and that's it!
